## 6 2 Loading Buttons


Using a Backbone collection, I built a loading button. The loading button fetches a collection when clicked, becomes disabled when clicked on/changes its text to "Loading...", and then returns to its normal state after the collection is finished being fetched.

-HTML -CSS -SCSS -Backbone (collections & events)
